## Install Guide (no technical experience needed)

### What you need

- A **Mac** running macOS 13 or later
- **Xcode** (free, from the Mac App Store — it's a large download, ~10 GB, give it time)
- An **iPhone or iPad** with Bluetooth, running iOS 16 or later
- A **free Apple ID** (the one you already use for the App Store is fine)
- A **PAX 3**

---

### Step 1 — Download the app code

1. Go to **[https://github.com/selfmeister/P3-VapeControl](https://github.com/selfmeister/P3-VapeControl)**
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
3. Open the downloaded ZIP — it will create a folder called `P3-VapeControl-main` on your Mac (usually in Downloads)

---

### Step 2 — Open in Xcode

1. Open the `P3-VapeControl-main` folder
2. Double-click **`PaxController.xcodeproj`** — Xcode will open

---

### Step 3 — Sign in with your Apple ID

Xcode needs your Apple ID to install apps on your own phone. This is free and does not require a paid developer account.

1. In Xcode, open the menu: **Xcode → Settings → Accounts**
2. Click the **+** button at the bottom left → **Add Apple ID**
3. Sign in with your regular Apple ID and password

---

### Step 4 — Set your signing team

1. In Xcode, click on **PaxController** in the left sidebar (the top blue icon)
2. In the main area, click on the **PaxController** target under "TARGETS"
3. Click the **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Under **Team**, click the dropdown and select your name / Apple ID
5. Xcode will automatically handle the rest

> If you see a bundle identifier error, just change `me.personal.PaxController` to something unique like `com.yourname.paxcontroller` in the Bundle Identifier field.

---

### Step 5 — Connect your iPhone

1. Plug your iPhone into your Mac with a USB cable
2. Unlock your iPhone and tap **Trust** if prompted
3. In Xcode, click the device selector at the top (it may say "Any iOS Device" or a simulator name)
4. Select your iPhone from the list

---

### Step 6 — Build and run

1. Press **⌘R** (or click the ▶ Play button in the top left of Xcode)
2. Xcode will build the app and install it on your phone — this takes a minute the first time
3. The app will launch on your iPhone automatically

---

### Step 7 — Trust the app on your iPhone

The first time you run a sideloaded app, iOS will block it until you trust it:

1. On your iPhone, go to **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**
2. Tap your Apple ID under "Developer App"
3. Tap **Trust "your Apple ID"** → Confirm

Now open the app — it's ready to use.

> ⚠️ The app must be built from a Mac with Xcode. It cannot run in the iOS Simulator because Bluetooth is not available there.

---

## Using the App

### Connecting to your PAX 3

1. **Power on your PAX 3** — press and hold the button until it vibrates
2. Open the app and go to the **Scan** tab
3. Tap **Scan** — your PAX 3 should appear within a few seconds
4. Tap **Connect** next to your device

### Monitoring

Switch to the **Device** tab to see:
- Battery level
- Heating state (Off / Standby / Heating / Ready / Cooling / Boost)
- Current oven temperature
- Target temperature
- Lock state, serial number, firmware version

Tap **↺** (top right) to manually refresh.

### Setting Temperature

Tap one of the four preset buttons in the Device tab: **180°C · 193°C · 204°C · 215°C**

### Debug Log

The **Log** tab shows a full trace of every Bluetooth packet sent and received — useful if something isn't working.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Device not found during scan | Make sure PAX is powered on and not already connected to another app |
| Temperatures show `--` | Tap ↺ to refresh after connecting |
| "No team" error in Xcode | Complete Step 3 and 4 above — sign in with your Apple ID |
| "Could not launch" on iPhone | Complete Step 7 — trust the developer certificate |
| Build fails: CommonCrypto not found | In Xcode Build Settings, verify `SWIFT_OBJC_BRIDGING_HEADER` points to `PaxController/Sources/PaxController-Bridging-Header.h` |
| App crashes immediately | Use a real device, not the Simulator |

---

## Safety

This app only reads device telemetry and sets the heater temperature to standard preset values — the same values available in the official app. It does **not** touch firmware, disable thermal limits, or override any safety cutoffs.

No data leaves your device. No network requests are made.

│   ├── PaxControllerApp.swift          Entry point (@main)
│   ├── PaxProtocol.swift               UUIDs, message types, AES crypto, packet codec

```

- **`BluetoothManager`** — single `@MainActor` `ObservableObject` driving all CoreBluetooth calls
- **`PaxProtocol.swift`** — fully isolated: all crypto, UUIDs, message types, packet encode/decode
- **Encryption** — AES-128 ECB (key derivation) + AES-128 OFB (packet encryption) via CommonCrypto bridging header
- **No SPM/CocoaPods dependencies**
